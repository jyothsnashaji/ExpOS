Read system call needs to lock the resources - Inode (file), buffer and disk before using them. These are locked in the order 1) Inode 2) buffer and 3) disk and released in the reverse order. This order is also followed while writing to a file. Ordering of resource acquisition is imposed in order to avoid processes getting into circular wait for resources. Avoiding circular wait prevents deadlocks.

Implement Read system call using detailed algorithm provided here.
